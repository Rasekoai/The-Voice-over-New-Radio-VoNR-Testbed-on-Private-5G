# Voice over New Radio (VoNR) Testbed on Private 5G

## Overview
This project develops a testbed for **Voice over New Radio (VoNR)** on a **private 5G network** using **Software Defined Radio (SDR)** and **open-source software**.  
Unlike previous studies that mainly focused on **network-centric metrics**, this work emphasizes the **Quality of Experience (QoE)** for end users.

## Objectives
- Build a functional testbed for VoNR over a private 5G network.  
- Identify the network conditions that deliver the best QoE.  
- Shift focus from traditional network performance to user experience.  

## Methodology
- Deploy SDR and open-source 5G software stack to simulate a private 5G environment.  
- Vary key network parameters: **latency**, **packet loss**, and **jitter**.  
- Evaluate QoE using the **Mean Opinion Score (MOS)** under different conditions.  
- Analyze results to determine thresholds and conditions that maximize QoE for VoNR.  

## Expected Outcomes
- Insights into how latency, jitter, and packet loss affect user-perceived voice quality.  
- Recommendations for suitable network metrics and thresholds to achieve optimal QoE.  
- A reusable testbed framework for future 5G/VoNR experiments.  

## Technologies
- Software Defined Radio (SDR)  
- Open-source 5G software stack (e.g., srsRAN, Open5GS)  
- Linux-based test environment
